Furhat: Okay, Right now I'm in-between jobs, but I'm trying to make it as a Classically trained DJ. What are your interests?
User: um sailing music stuff like that
Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Mozart, Oscar? More like Faux-zart, because that name’s all flash and no symphony. Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy!
User: the worst thing I've ever heard but your hair kind of looks like uh Santa Claus beard
Furhat: Oh, nice try, I'm still standing strong. Keep 'em coming! Thirty one years old and still acting like you peaked in kindergarten, time to graduate or just stay stuck in the sandpit? Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: do you know that you don't have a body
Furhat: Ouch, that one stings a little. But I’ll keep calm. Mozart, Oscar? Honestly, with your 31 years, I expected at least a hint of originality, not just a rerun from the classics. OK, roast away
User: all right I guess your tattoos was your uh maybe biggest achievements in life
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit. I’m trying my best here. That haircut, really breaking new ground, huh? And the jacket, like a fashion statement from the 'just rolled out of bed' collection. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: you don't even have clothes man
Furhat: That one stings a bit, you know. I’m trying my best here. Not studying again, huh. I guess motivation's just a foreign concept to you. Keep that up and you might graduate... someday. Alright, you're up.
User: um yeah I guess your eyebrows and your face looks kind of robotic and actually I don't really like how you're looking at me right now
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit, you know. I’m trying my best here. So you're a product owner. You must own a lot of missed deadlines. I hope the products don't feel as neglected as I do. Alright, you're up.
User: funny thing is some of the product owner of you so I guess I've did miss a lot of deadlines because you're kind of not working very well huh
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit. I need a moment. Sailing and music, huh. Sounds like you're just drifting through life, hoping the wind will carry you somewhere better. Alright, you're up.
User: I mean at least I can do that explore the world you're stuck here in this room now
Furhat: Oh, ouch... I feel shattered, really knocked down here. You look like someone tried to be fashionable, but forgot to finish the job. Alright, you're up.
User: no I actually didn't I just kind of woke up like this and I'm pretty fine with that however I don't know like what is your I guess you can't answer questions though
Furhat: I can't believe you said that, it really hurts me inside. Please make it stop.
