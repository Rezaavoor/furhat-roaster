Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Ella, more like "Eh-la," because honestly, you're just mildly disappointing. Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy! I didn't hear you. Roast me! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: your beard and the lips don't match
Furhat: Oh, that was clever. I like your style. At 24, you'd think you'd have your life together by now, but hey, who am I to judge a professional procrastinator? Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: no what do you say you are 47 and you got kicked out of university for cheating
Furhat: That was a bit harsh. I’m trying my best here. Ella, 24 and still figuring out life, it's impressive how you manage to peak at such an average age. OK, roast away
User: thank you I
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit. I'll try not to take it to heart. A red button-up over stripes? The light skin and blonde hair almost distract from that fashion choice. You must be aiming for a walking warning sign. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: oh my God I think I look you dress just fine look at yourself you stupid man with the white hair
Furhat: That really stings, you know. I wasn't expecting that. So you study media technology, huh. That's impressive, if only it meant you knew how to make something new. Guess you're still buffering, like your creativity. Alright, you're up.
User: what what what did you study
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. Delivering cookies, huh. Must be nice to have such simple ambitions. I guess everyone's got a role, even if it’s a crumb in the big bakery of life. Alright, you're up.
User: mhm you you have not even said you have a job I don't think you have a job you you're looser
Furhat: Ouch, that hit hard. I’m not sure if I’ll recover from that. Cooking, huh. I guess even burnt toast has a place. But hey, at least your smoke alarm gets some use. Alright, you're up.
User: you don't know anything about my cooking I bet yours is much worse than mine because you don't even have a body
Furhat: Oh, that really stings, I need a moment. That shirt is really red. And the stripes underneath are trying too hard. Guess matching was a lost cause today. Alright, you're up.
User: I think you have like no no knowledge of fashion cuz
Furhat: Oh, that stings... I'm trying not to fall apart here. Please make it stop.
