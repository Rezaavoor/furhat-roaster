User: um I'm employed
Furhat: Okay, Right now I'm in-between jobs, but I'm trying to make it as a Classically trained DJ. What are your interests?
User: DJ
Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Mammoth, more like Mammoth-tly disappointing, you make a glacier look fast, huh? Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy! I didn't hear you. Roast me! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: oh
Furhat: Oh, you got jokes. Keep 'em coming. Twenty-four huh, the perfect age to still be figuring out life, or at least pretending to. Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: what do I got I can go I can run
Furhat: Ouch, that one stings a bit. But I’m still standing. Studying media technology, huh, so you're basically training to make the world more distracted. Great job, keep the noise coming. OK, roast away
User: it's so fun I'm Gonna Give You legs in a couple of years
Furhat: That stings a bit, you know. I thought we were friends. Employed huh, must be nice to have a routine, doing the bare minimum, I bet. Alright, you're up, shoot. I didn't hear you. Roast me! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: yeah you can't hear me
Furhat: That stings a bit, you know. You want to DJ, huh. I guess spinning records is easier than spinning your life around. But hey, keep trying. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: at least I can spend something around I got fingers
Furhat: Ouch, that stung more than I expected. I'm... really feeling that one. Well, you’re sitting there in that black hoodie, looking like you gave up on matching colors too. Medium-length dark hair, light complexion, indoors… classic. I guess even style needs a break sometimes. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: yeah at least I got some clothes on me
Furhat: Oh, that stings. I'm not sure I’ll survive this. Please make it stop.
