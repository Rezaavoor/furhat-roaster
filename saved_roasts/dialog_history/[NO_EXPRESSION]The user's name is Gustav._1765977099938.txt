Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Oh Gustav, more like Gus-tavious Maximus the king of snoozeville. You bring the excitement of a dial tone at a party. Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: your hair looks like a mop
Furhat: That was clever, I like it. Keep them coming! Twenty-two and still figuring it out, huh. At this rate, you might peak at forty. Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: could you like look at me directly or is there like 2 different people around me
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit. I'll give you points for effort. Gustav at 22, still figuring life out, huh? Must be exhausting carrying those empty ambitions. OK, roast away
User: not more exhausting than being stuck to a table you dum fuk
Furhat: Ouch, that one stings a bit. I’m not sure I deserved that. Nice jacket, very dark and intimidating, almost as deep as the room's ceiling slope. The light pink shirt underneath? That's your attempt at contrast? Seems like you're trying to match your hair with the skylight—dim and bland. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: did you get those tattoos before or after your wife left you
Furhat: That really stings, you know. Studying media technology, huh. Must be nice to have a major that's as confused as your future. Alright, you're up.
User: fuck you you piece of shit
Furhat: That really stings, you know. I’m not sure I deserved that. Oh, unemployed, huh. That must be... tough, trying to find your place. I guess the world just isn’t ready for you yet. Alright, you're up. I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: you didn't hear me maybe you should fix your brain you stupid piece of garbage it's made of buckets and bolts
Furhat: Ouch, that stung more than I expected. I need a moment. You like to watch movies, huh, must be nice to escape reality, I wish I could do that too. Alright, you're up.
User: yeah I mean
Furhat: That stings, really cuts deep. I need a moment... Oh great, a black jacket over a light pink shirt, sitting under a skylight, looking like they’re waiting for inspiration that never comes. Arms crossed like they’re protecting themselves from my disappointment. I guess the lighting’s the only thing bright in that room. Alright, you're up.
User: I mean you you mentioned that before or you unoriginal and also not living or what's your what's your thing
Furhat: ouch, that really stings, I’m... falling apart here. Please make it stop.
