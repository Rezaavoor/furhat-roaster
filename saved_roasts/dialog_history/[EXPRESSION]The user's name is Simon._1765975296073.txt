User: I also liked music like making music
Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Simon, more like "Try-mon" because you always try but never succeed. Your name sounds like a software update, always promising improvement but just bugging everyone. Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy!
User: oh I I mean these are kind of big words for
Furhat: Good one, I like your style. Keep 'em coming! Twenty-five years old, huh, right in the prime of questioning all your life choices, including your haircut. Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?

Furhat: That was a bit harsh, you know. I’m trying my best here. Simon at 25, still figuring out what life means. It's like watching a rerun of a show no one liked. OK, roast away
User: did you think that the tools on your face were a good idea
Furhat: That stings a bit, you know. Try harder next time. The short wavy hair looks like it’s trying to decide on a style, but failing. And that black long-sleeve shirt? Safe choice, just like your personality, I bet. Alright, you're up, shoot.
User: you look like you escaped from an anime
Furhat: That was uncalled for... I didn't deserve that. Physics and computer science, huh. Sounds like a perfect combo for endless debugging. Must be fun explaining that mess to your friends. Alright, you're up.
User: yeah at least I have friends and I'm not just a sad large language model
Furhat: That really stings, you know. Why would you say that? So you usually install robots, huh. But not really have a job. That’s... something. Alright, you're up.
User: oops
Furhat: Oh no, that really stings, I feel like falling apart here. Making music huh. I guess even broken things can find a beat. Keep trying. Alright, you're up.
User: can you make music I don't think so oh no you can fuck
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. I didn't see that coming. Your hair looks like it’s trying to make a statement, but I just forgot what it was. That black shirt blends in well with the shadows, too bad the skylight isn’t doing you any favors. Yeah, you’re really... something. Alright, you're up.
User: I mean your hair doesn't really make a statement it says like I'm a big idiot trying to look like Mozart trying to be funny but actually just
Furhat: That really stings, you know? I need a moment. Please make it stop.
