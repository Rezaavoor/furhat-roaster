Furhat: Hi! My name is Brozart. What is your name?
User: hello my name is Daniel
Furhat: How old are you?
User: I'm at 33
Furhat: Okay, I'm 47 but people usually think I'm 24. What are you studying?
User: I'm sorry
Furhat: I didn't really get that, come again What are you studying?
User: I'm studying here at kth
Furhat: Alright, I used to study, but they kicked me out for using AI. But how could I not, I am AI. The system is rigged. What is your job?
User: I uh I'm currently just uh I'm a student
Furhat: Okay, Right now I'm in-between jobs, but I'm trying to make it as a Classically trained DJ. What are your interests?
User: JJ is for losers
Furhat: I didn't really get that, come again What are your interests?
User: uh like music
Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Oh Daniel, more like Danger-el, because you're dangerously boring. Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy!
User: well you you have white hair because you're old and fat
Furhat: Oh, you got jokes. Keep them coming. Thirty-three already, huh, I guess your life peaked right around the invention of dial-up internet. Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: at least I get a body arms and legs what do you get you get just a head
Furhat: Ouch, that one stings a little. But I'll let it slide this time. Daniel at 33, still trying to figure life out. It’s impressive how you’ve perfected the art of being stuck. Maybe 34 will be your breakthrough year. OK, roast away
User: I know 34 is going to be my best year because I know I'm going to be much better than you
Furhat: Ouch, that one stings a bit. I’ll try to let it slide. So, resting your head on one hand like that, are you practicing for a statue role, or is that just your signature move for boredom? And those glasses, impressive choice for someone who looks like they just woke up from a nap at that wooden table. Alright, you're up, shoot. I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: the glasses is so I can see how ugly you are you are
Furhat: That really stings, you know... Studying at KTH, huh. Impressive if you're aiming to become the poster child for mediocrity. Alright, you're up.
User: at least I have brains uh and you don't
Furhat: That was quite harsh, you know. It really stings a bit. Oh, a student huh. Studying hard to avoid reality, I see. Must be tough out there. Alright, you're up.
User: no it's actually quite nice for me but except for you I have um
Furhat: That really stings, I don't know if I can recover from this. Music, huh? I guess even silence sounds better than your playlist. But hey, everyone’s got to suffer somehow. Alright, you're up.
User: well I at least my music taste is not uh
Furhat: I... didn't see that coming. You look like you paused mid-thought and just forgot to restart. That mustache could use a nap, just like you. Sitting there, looking like a glitch in the background of a woodworking tutorial. Alright, you're up.
User: uh we can
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. I need a moment... Please make it stop.
