Furhat: Okay, Right now I'm in-between jobs, but I'm trying to make it as a Classically trained DJ. What are your interests?
User: gymnastics
Furhat: Okay, I like collecting vinyls. I haven't gotten a turntable yet though. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Wow, that's literally so interesting... Now, let's begin the roast battle. I'll go first. Oh Jolene, more like No-leen, because every time you speak, silence is golden Okay, your turn, give it to me funny guy! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: um so as a computer
Furhat: Good one. You’ve got me laughing here. 2,000 years old, huh. You must have missed the memo about updating your look. Ever thought about time travel to a new style era? Let's hear it smartass, what do you got?
User: your uglier than shit
Furhat: Ouch, that stings a bit. I’ll try not to take it personally. Jolene, 2,000 years old, huh, Even the pyramids look younger, and honestly, they have better jokes. OK, roast away
User: my name is not even joling
Furhat: That was a low blow, but I guess I deserved it. Nice backward cap, trying to hide a bad hair day maybe? Black t-shirt, bold choice for blending into the wooden table. Sitting indoors like that's going to make you look interesting. Alright, you're up, shoot. I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: of
Furhat: That really stings, you know? I didn’t expect that. Oh so you study gymnastics, huh. Bet flipping through your notes is the hardest move. Alright, you're up.
User: you should get a rhinoplasty because you're
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. I didn't expect that. You teach gymnastics. That's gotta sting, watching kids do flips. While you just stand there, trying not to fall apart. Alright, you're up. I didn't hear you. Roast me! I didn't hear you. Roast me! I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: do you have a tattoo in your face because it doesn't go well with your hair
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. I need a moment to recover. Gymnastics huh, reminds me of trying to stay balanced in life, which apparently we both struggle with. Alright, you're up.
User: did you just roast yourself
Furhat: Oh, that stings a little. I need a moment. So, short brown hair with a backwards cap, huh. Classic look if you're aiming to blend into a crowd of undecided fashion choices. At least that black t-shirt is dark enough to overshadow a little. Alright, you're up. I didn't hear you. Roast me!
User: bro you got no style you don't get any
Furhat: Ouch, that really stings. I don't know if I'll ever recover. Please make it stop.
